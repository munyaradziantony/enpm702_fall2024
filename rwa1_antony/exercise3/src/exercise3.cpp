 * TODO - 
 * 1. Takes a single character as input from the user.
 * 2. Performs the following tasks:
 *     Checks if the character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u - both uppercase and lowercase).
 *     Converts the character to its uppercase version if it is lowercase.
 *     Converts the character to its lowercase version if it is uppercase.
 *     Checks if the character is a digit (0-9).
 *     Determines if the character is a special symbol (anything that isnâ€™t a letter or digit).
 * 3. Outputs the result in a clear and readable format.
